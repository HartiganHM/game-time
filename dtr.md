# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation. 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Learning goals to implement strong use of canvas and implement ES6 syntax structure. Multiple JS file usage along with clean code organization. Make a sweet game!

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Pair programming mostly together, but some time apart is okay. Mostly work together in the mornings and after school. Meeting up on Sunday for a couple of hours. After class during the week if necessary. 

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
In person thing if something comes up. Slack, text if needed.

* How would you describe your work style?
Plan things out, but try new things. Separate JS files will make it so everything doesn't break. Get things working and then clean-up code.

* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Hugh: Organized, JS hadnle, styling, Git/GitHub
Patrick: Styling, JS handle, ES6 starting, communication

* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Making sure work is split in an intuitive way. Working together and staying on the same page is important. Strong communication regardless of situation. Keeping calm, but staying focused.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Communicating with one another and having a solid plan. Deliberate direction of action.

* How will we overcome obstacles?
Talk through issues together and brainstorm. Ask for help if it's needed. Try to solve together, but reach out to other resources if necessary.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Strong communication. Willingness to be flexible with timing, etc. Moderately quiet workspace. 

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Some plans on the weekend, but nothing crazy. Mostly flexible schedule. Turn off around 10 PM. 

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Direct, honest feedback that's considerate. When people are stressed, we hold back, but don't forsee that being an issue in this partnership. If it is, we will discuss.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Hugh: Organized, JS hadnle, styling, Git/GitHub
Patrick: Styling, JS handle, ES6 starting, communication

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Waffle for organization. Slack/text for communicating. GitHub for project specific tasks/issues. 

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Talk through issues together and brainstorm. Ask for help if it's needed. Try to solve together, but reach out to other resources if necessary.


* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Project is successful if it embodies what we set out to achieve, if we learn something in the process, and have a good time doing it.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
High fives, yelling, celebratory beers.
